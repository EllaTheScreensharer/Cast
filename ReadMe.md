# What is Cast?
Cast is a Minecraft Bedrock & Java screensharing tool that allows you to see if a person is using cheats or has cheats located on their server, once the program is opened it will open a panel where you must click 'Scan' for it to scan and find cheats.

# How do I install it?
To install cast, first install the setup and run the file on your desktop, then install and run the scanner, once it has been ran, click the scan button and it will automatically start scanning files on the user's desktop. This process may vary in time depending on the specs of the computer you are using.

# How can I support this?
You dont need to, using the tool is fine enough!
